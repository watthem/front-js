# Basic Counter Example

> **Status:** Placeholder for v0.0.3

This example will demonstrate:

- Server-rendered HTML with `data-island`.
- A simple `Counter` component using `val()` and `run()`.
- Hydration with `register()` + `hydrate()`.

## How to run

```bash
npx serve .
# then open /examples/basic-counter/index.html
```

## Files

- `index.html` - Server-rendered page with island markers
- `app.js` - Client-side component registration and hydration

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Islands Architecture basics
- Reactive values with `val()`
- Component registration
- Hydration from server HTML
- Event handling in islands

**TODO for v0.0.3:** Implement complete working example
