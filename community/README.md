# Community Knowledge

This directory contains tribal knowledge, user feedback, and community insights that may not be suitable for formal documentation.

## Purpose

The files in this directory represent:
- **User feedback** from real-world usage
- **Trial and error** discoveries
- **Workarounds** and patterns discovered by the community
- **Feature requests** and discussions

## Contributing

If you have feedback, insights, or discoveries about front.js:

1. **For specific issues or bugs**: Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/your-org/front-js/issues)
2. **For feature requests**: Open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/your-org/front-js/discussions)
3. **For questions**: Start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/your-org/front-js/discussions)

**We encourage you to use GitHub Discussions and Issues** rather than adding files here. This keeps the repository lean and ensures knowledge is accessible to everyone through GitHub's search and organization features.
